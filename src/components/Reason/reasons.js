    about:
      "We Provide a very distinctive API trading system for users working with account managers. Expert Trading account managers can place trades directly into a user’s account via a unique API key for each user. With this unique key, an account manager will link your account to his trading portal and will have access to only trading features on a user’s account and will not have full control over a client’s account capital. There are over 34,000 licensed registered account managers on the platform with over 5 years of experience. The API key can only be used by a registered account manager on the platform.",

    title: "NFT (Non-fungible token)",
    about:
      "NFTs (or “non-fungible tokens”) are a special kind of crypto assets in which each token is unique — as opposed to “fungible” assets like Bitcoin and dollar bills, which are all worth exactly the same amount. Because every NFT is unique, it can be used to authenticate ownership of digital assets like artworks, recordings, and virtual real estate or pets.",
